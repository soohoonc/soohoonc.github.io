title: 5 Years of Software Engineering

Here I briefly document the first 5 years of my software engineering career. 

I wrote my first line of code in 2020 and while I still have a lot to learn, I am in a position where I can claim that I can build things that other engineers [find useful](https://greptile.com). I outline a rough summary of some of the key points that helped me become the engineer I am today.s

## 2020

- Take CS 1371, computing for engineers, second semester of freshman year as a biomedical engineering student, it is the most interesting class I have taken so far.
- Binge watch as many major + career advice as possible, everyone is recommending computer science (CS).
- Observe that all the "cool companies" are hiring out of CS. The company I am most interested in, Neuralink, is hiring more CS majors than biomedical engineering majors.
- Join a research lab working on BCI's, PI tells me that majoring in CS is probably more helpful for actual research.
- Attempt a computer science interview, [try two sum on leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/soohoonchoi/) and get my ass kicked. Realize how far behind the curve I am.
- Take summer courses in programming 101 to see if I really want to be a CS major (Java OOP)
- Fall 2020: Switch majors to CS, take data structures and algorithms, software design, and computer systems I.
- Join the most technical sounding CS campus organizations: machine learning club, computer security club, and competitive programming club. See what the standard of a good computer science student is.

This header is a lie, I wrote my first line of code in 2019 during a gap year before college, which was `print("Hello, World!")` in the python repl inside my powershell. I wasn't blown away by the the computer greeting my in this primitive UI, but decided to watch a couple of videos on it and go through the rounds of [creating a GitHub account](https://github.com/soohoonc?tab=overview&from=2019-12-01&to=2019-12-31) and such. However no serious programming was done. 

My first non trivial line of code was during the Spring 2020 semester of college during CS 1371, Computing for Engineers, as a biomedical engineering student. This class showed me how you could use code to do anything from image processing to computing numerical solutions to differential equations. 

One good thing that I decided to do at this point was to listen to as many major + career advice as possible. 

At the very least I wanted to add computer science as a minor to my degree, so over the summer I decided to take object oriented programming in Java.

By the fall I was applying to switch my major to computer science. I decided to take, data structures and algorithms, software design, and computer systems I in the Fall 2020 semester.

Another good decision I made was to join as many of the most technical sounding computer science campus organizations as possible. I ended up attending meetings for the machine learning club, the computer security club, and the competitive programming club (as all meetings were remote). A lot of the material covered in these meetings was way extremely foreign to me, but what it did help with was calibrating my expectectations for what a computer science major who truly enjoys what they do is like. They were internally motivated by learning and practicing the subject matters themselves and were way ahead of the curve in terms of familiarity and mastery of a lot of computer science topics. Another thing that struck me was that the members of these organizations were not partitioned by subject, but that there were core members who were going to all of these organization meets (and actually contributing unlike me who was mostly observing at this point). The skill level for these students were way better than the regular students who just went to class, it is a lot larger that most people realize in my experience.

## 2021

- Spring 2021: Take database design, systems II, and intro to AI.
- Internship search, get into Amazon (really excited), but end up not being able to attend because of visa issues.
- Instead take a summer courses on computer networking, algorithm design, and machine learning.
- Realize that at this rate I will finish my CS major next semester. I still want to do an internship + learn more, so consider adding a math minor/major.
- Fall of 2021: Take database systems, deep learning, and complexity & automata theory.
- Also take the junior capstone course, where I meet my now cofounder Daksh, we start working on projects together.

## 2022

- Spring 2022: Take computer vision, and math major courses.
- Apply and decide on Microsoft internship for the Summer.
- Participate in the college accelerator ([Create X](https://create-x.gatech.edu/)) with Daksh for our side project/startup, work through summer nights + weekends.
- Fall 2022: Take computer security, quantum computing (was just linear algebra 3).
- Worked as a TA for computer vision (wanted deep learning), did not get paid much as I forgot to log hours.
- Joined the programming languages club (goated club), get functional-pilled.
- ChatGPT drops in November, our side project feels more realistic.

## 2023

- Spring 2023: Take OS design because I couldn't fit in compilers to my schedule.
- The start up is going to conferences, raising seed rounds, and getting rejected from YC.
- Decide to move to San Francisco to work on the startup full time after graduation.
- Start programming all day for work (React, Typescript, Next.js, AWS).
- Pivot from college side project to AI chat with your codebase at the [Scale AI hackathon](https://scale.com/blog/generative-ai-hackathon-2).

## 2024

- Go through the longest day I have ever worked during YC (HN launch, scaling, midnight database column drop in one day).
- Basically code all day all year (pretty sure I got my 10k hours in).
- Typescript, AWS, Kubernetes daily(hell), but decided to have fun with OCaml for advent of code (you should have fun programming).
- Decide to go all in on AI code reviews in December.

## 2025

- Start experiencing signs of PMF in the company, engineering problems start to feel a little different.
- Need to hire and grow the company.
- Start talking to engineers more, realize engineering with a team comes with a whole new set of problems.
- Currently trying to understand running + scaling engineering teams and building scalable, reliable, maintainable, and tasteful software.

## Hindsight

There a couple of things that I regret looking back upon my journey so far. I wish I continued doing research, I stopped shortly after when things went remote and I failed to meaningfully contribute in this environment.
Not becoming good at programming fast enough made me lose out on one of the core college experiences I was looking forward to. 
I wish I had taken the opportunities in each organization I joined more seriously. Participating in more CTFs, competitions, and hackathons, even if I knew I was not as good as the others would have forced me to become better faster.
I wish I had worked on projects with greater breadth. The only real side project I worked on was the side project/startup with Daksh starting junior year of college. I wish I was able to work on building things like my own OS, programming language (tbf I did a bit of this), auto diff library, etc. There are so many things I want to build now but I didn't have the foresight of planning during college where I had the time to do so.


I am glad I took as many classes that I could, I took classes outside my concentration of AI and databases to learn about systems and all things math. I think it gave me a good primer of what was out there.
I am glad I came from a "non-traditional" engineering background. I was deciding between medical school, art school, or seminary going into college, it was what I was preparing for in high school. While some part of me does wish that I started out earlier in programming or math competitions, this makes life more interesting and I couldn't ask for anything better than that.
