title: 5 Years of Software Engineering

Here I briefly document the first 5 years of my software engineering career.

I wrote my first line of code in 2020 and while I still have a lot to learn, I am now at a spot where I can build things from the ground up that some other engineers [find useful](https://greptile.com). I will outline a rough summary of some of the key points that helped me get here to reflect upon and to serve as reference for those who care.

## 2020

- Take my first programming class CS 1371, computing for engineers in my second semester of freshman year as a biomedical engineering student. It is the most interesting class I have taken so far.
- Binge watch as many major + career advice videos as possible, everyone is recommending computer science (CS).
- Observe that all the "cool companies" are hiring out of CS after attending different career fairs. The company I am most interested in, Neuralink, is hiring more CS majors than biomedical engineering majors.
- Join a research lab working on BCIs, PI tells me that majoring in CS is probably more helpful for actual research.
- Take summer courses in intro to OOP to see if I really want to be a CS major (not a good class to start with looking back).
- Attempt a computer science interview, [try two sum on leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/soohoonchoi/) and get my ass kicked. Realize how far behind the curve I am.
- Fall 2020: Switch majors to CS, take data structures and algorithms, software design, and computer systems I. I want to take as many classes as possible to learn as fast as possible.
- Join the most technical sounding CS campus organizations: machine learning club, computer security club, and competitive programming club. See what the standard of a good computer science student is.

## 2021

- Spring 2021: Take database design, systems II, and intro to AI, continue to classmaxx.
- Start internship search, get into Amazon during peak ZIRP hiring, but end up not being able to attend because of visa issues.
- Instead take more courses over the summer on computer networking, algorithm design, and machine learning.
- Realize that at this rate I will finish my CS major next semester. I still want to do an internship + learn more, so consider adding a math minor/major.
- Fall of 2021: Take database systems, deep learning, and complexity & automata theory.
- Also take the junior capstone course, where I meet my now cofounder [Daksh](https://dakskgupta.com), we start working on projects together.

## 2022

- Spring 2022: Take computer vision, and math major courses.
- Apply and decide on Microsoft internship for the summer.
- Participate in the college accelerator ([Create X](https://create-x.gatech.edu/)) with Daksh for our side project/startup, work through summer nights + weekends.
- Fall 2022: Take computer security, quantum computing (was just linear algebra 3) and more math classes.
- Worked as a TA for computer vision (wanted deep learning), did not get paid much as I forgot to log hours.
- Joined the programming languages club (goated club), got functional-pilled.
- ChatGPT drops in November, our side project feels more important

## 2023

- Spring 2023: Take OS design (I couldn't fit compilers into my schedule) and finish up math requirements.
- The startup is going to conferences, raising seed rounds, and getting rejected from YC.
- Decide to move to San Francisco to work on the startup full time after graduation.
- Start programming all day for work (SF starter pack: React, Typescript, Next.js, AWS).
- Pivot from college side project to AI chat with your codebase at the [Scale AI hackathon](https://scale.com/blog/generative-ai-hackathon-2).

## 2024

- Basically code all day all year (did the math on this pretty sure I got my 10k hours in).
- Go through the longest day I have ever worked during YC (HN launch, scaling, midnight database crsis in one day).
- Typescript and Kubernetes daily (hell), but had fun learning OCaml for various side projects (you should have fun programming).
- Decide to pivot again and go all in on AI code reviews in December.

## 2025

- Start experiencing signs of [PMF](https://a16z.com/12-things-about-product-market-fit/) at the company, engineering problems start to feel a little different.
- Need to hire and grow the company, realize that engineering with a team comes with a whole new set of problems.
- Currently trying to understand running + scaling engineering teams and building scalable, reliable, maintainable, and tasteful software.

## Hindsight

There are a couple of things that I regret looking back upon my journey so far:

- I wish I had continued doing research, I stopped shortly after when things went remote and I failed to meaningfully contribute in this environment. Not becoming good at programming fast enough made me lose out on one of the core college experiences I was looking forward to.
- I wish I had taken the opportunities in each organization I joined more seriously. Participating in more CTFs, competitions, and hackathons, even if I knew I was not as good as the others would have forced me to become better faster.
- I wish I had worked on projects with greater breadth. The only real side project I worked on was the side project/startup with Daksh starting junior year of college. Now I rarely have the time to do so :(

Here are the things that I am glad I did:

- I am glad I took as many classes as I could, I took classes outside my concentration of AI and databases to learn about systems and all things math. I think it gave me a good primer of what was out there.
- I am glad I came from a "non-traditional" engineering background. I was deciding between medical school, art school, and seminary going into college, it was what I was preparing for in high school. While some part of me wishes that I had started out earlier programming or participated math competitions, this diversity makes life more interesting and I couldn't ask for anything better than that.
