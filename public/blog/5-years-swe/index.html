    <h1>5 Years of Software Engineering</h1>
    <p><small>2025-12-21</small></p>
    <br />
    <p>Here I briefly document the first 5 years of my software engineering career.</p>
<p>I still have a long ways to go, however in the past 5 years I have learned enough to say that I can build things that some number of other engineers <a href="https://greptile.com">find useful</a>. Each of these points I believe helped me to become the engineer I am today.</p>
<h2>2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take CS 1371, computing for engineers, second semester of freshman year as a biomedical engineering student, it is the most interesting class I have taken so far.</li>
<li>Binge watch as many major + career advice as possible, everyone is recommending computer science (CS).</li>
<li>Observe that all the "cool companies" are hiring out of CS. The company I am most interested in, Neuralink, is hiring more CS majors than biomedical engineering majors.</li>
<li>Attempt a computer science interview, <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/soohoonchoi/">try two sum on leetcode</a> and get my ass kicked. Realize how far behind the curve I am.</li>
<li>Take summer courses in programming 101 to see if I really want to be a CS major (Java OOP 💔)</li>
<li>Fall 2020: Switch majors to CS, take data structures and algorithms, software design, and computer systems I.</li>
<li>Join the most technical sounding CS campus organizations: machine learning club, computer security club, and competitive programming club. See what the standard of a good computer science student is.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spring 2021: Take database design, systems II, and intro to AI.</li>
<li>Internship search, get into Amazon (really excited), but end up not being able to attend because of visa issues.</li>
<li>Instead take a summer courses on computer networking, algorithm design, and machine learning.</li>
<li>Realize that at this rate I will finish my CS major next semester. I still want to do an internship + learn more, so consider adding a math minor/major.</li>
<li>Fall of 2021: Take database systems, deep learning, and complexity &#x26; automata theory.</li>
<li>Also take the junior capstone course, where I meet my now cofounder Daksh, we start working on projects together.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2022</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spring 2022: Take computer vision, and math major courses.</li>
<li>Apply and decide on Microsoft internship for the Summer.</li>
<li>Participate in the college accelerator (<a href="https://create-x.gatech.edu/">Create X</a>) with Daksh for our side project/startup, work through summer nights + weekends.</li>
<li>Fall 2022: Take computer security, quantum computing (was just linear algebra 3).</li>
<li>Worked as a TA for computer vision (wanted deep learning 😔), did not get paid much as I forgot to log hours.</li>
<li>Joined the programming languages club (goated club), get functional-pilled.</li>
<li>ChatGPT drops in November, our side project feels more realistic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2023</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spring 2023: Take OS design because I couldn't fit in compilers to my schedule.</li>
<li>The start up is going to conferences, raising seed rounds, and getting rejected from YC.</li>
<li>Decide to move to San Francisco to work on the startup full time after graduation.</li>
<li>Start programming all day for work (React, Typescript, Next.js, AWS 🤢).</li>
<li>Pivot from college side project to AI chat with your codebase at the <a href="https://scale.com/blog/generative-ai-hackathon-2">Scale AI hackathon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2024</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go through the longest day I have ever worked during YC (HN launch, scaling, midnight database column drop in one day).</li>
<li>Basically code all day all year (pretty sure I got my 10k hours in).</li>
<li>Typescript, AWS, Kubernetes (hell), but some fun with OCaml for advent of code (you should have fun programming).</li>
<li>Decide to go all in on AI code reviews in December.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2025</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start experiencing signs of PMF in the company, engineering problems start to feel a little different.</li>
<li>Need to hire and grow the company.</li>
<li>Start talking to engineers more, realize engineering with a team comes with a whole new set of problems.</li>
<li>Currently trying to understand running + scaling engineering teams and building scalable, reliable, maintainable, and tasteful software.</li>
</ul>
