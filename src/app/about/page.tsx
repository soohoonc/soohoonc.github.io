      <p>
        I am currently working as a cofounder at <a href='https://getonboard.dev/'>Onboard</a> were
        we are exploring the potential application of LLMs in the dev tools space. I was born in
        Korea, grew up in the Philippines, and moved to the US for college and beyond. I graduated
        from Georgia Tech with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, love those majors. If I
        could do college again I would go with physics and philosophy as they seem more fun. I am
        currently living in San Francisco, CA builing Onboard. You can probably catch me at one of
        the big AI events or hackathons in the Bay Area or at a random cafe on the weekends.
